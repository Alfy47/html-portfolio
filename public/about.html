<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 6 months ago, I decided it was time to take a big risk and change my profession.  I was a digital marketer for over 20 years and then decided to become a developer.  It is something I have always wanted to do.</p>

<p>In my marketing role I had lots of exposure to web development and like to build things.  I am also a natural problem solver.</p>

<h3>My interests include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hanging out with my daughter</li>
  <li>Coaching football</li>
  <li>Going to the beach</li>
</ul>
